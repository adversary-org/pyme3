<h3 class="section">5.3 Error Codes</h3>

<p><a name="index-error-codes_002c-list-of-76"></a>
The library <code>libgpg-error</code> defines many error values.  Most of
them are not used by <code>GPGME</code> directly, but might be returned by
<acronym>GPGME</acronym> because it received them from the crypto engine.  The
below list only includes such error codes that have a specific meaning
in <code>GPGME</code>, or which are so common that you should know about
them.

     <dl>
<dt><code>GPG_ERR_EOF</code><dd>This value indicates the end of a list, buffer or file.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR</code><dd>This value indicates success.  The value of this error code is
<code>0</code>.  Also, it is guaranteed that an error value made from the
error code <code>0</code> will be <code>0</code> itself (as a whole).  This means
that the error source information is lost for this error code,
however, as this error code indicates that no error occured, this is
generally not a problem.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_GENERAL</code><dd>This value means that something went wrong, but either there is not
enough information about the problem to return a more useful error
value, or there is no separate error value for this type of problem.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_ENOMEM</code><dd>This value means that an out-of-memory condition occurred.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_E...</code><dd>System errors are mapped to GPG_ERR_FOO where FOO is the symbol for
the system error.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_INV_VALUE</code><dd>This value means that some user provided data was out of range.  This
can also refer to objects.  For example, if an empty
<code>gpgme_data_t</code> object was expected, but one containing data was
provided, this error value is returned.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_UNUSABLE_PUBKEY</code><dd>This value means that some recipients for a message were invalid.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_UNUSABLE_SECKEY</code><dd>This value means that some signers were invalid.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_NO_DATA</code><dd>This value means that a <code>gpgme_data_t</code> object which was expected
to have content was found empty.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_CONFLICT</code><dd>This value means that a conflict of some sort occurred.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED</code><dd>This value indicates that the specific function (or operation) is not
implemented.  This error should never happen.  It can only occur if
you use certain values or configuration options which do not work,
but for which we think that they should work at some later time.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_DECRYPT_FAILED</code><dd>This value indicates that a decryption operation was unsuccessful.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_BAD_PASSPHRASE</code><dd>This value means that the user did not provide a correct passphrase
when requested.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_CANCELED</code><dd>This value means that the operation was canceled.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_INV_ENGINE</code><dd>This value means that the engine that implements the desired protocol
is currently not available.  This can either be because the sources
were configured to exclude support for this engine, or because the
engine is not installed properly.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_AMBIGUOUS_NAME</code><dd>This value indicates that a user ID or other specifier did not specify
a unique key.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_WRONG_KEY_USAGE</code><dd>This value indicates that a key is not used appropriately.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_CERT_REVOKED</code><dd>This value indicates that a key signature was revoced.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_CERT_EXPIRED</code><dd>This value indicates that a key signature expired.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_NO_CRL_KNOWN</code><dd>This value indicates that no certificate revocation list is known for
the certificate.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_NO_POLICY_MATCH</code><dd>This value indicates that a policy issue occured.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_NO_SECKEY</code><dd>This value indicates that no secret key for the user ID is available.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_MISSING_CERT</code><dd>This value indicates that a key could not be imported because the
issuer certificate is missing.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_BAD_CERT_CHAIN</code><dd>This value indicates that a key could not be imported because its
certificate chain is not good, for example it could be too long.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ALGORITHM</code><dd>This value means a verification failed because the cryptographic
algorithm is not supported by the crypto backend.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_BAD_SIGNATURE</code><dd>This value means a verification failed because the signature is bad.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_NO_PUBKEY</code><dd>This value means a verification failed because the public key is not
available.

     <br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_USER_1</code><br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_USER_2</code><br><dt><code>...</code><br><dt><code>GPG_ERR_USER_16</code><dd>These error codes are not used by any GnuPG component and can be
freely used by other software.  Applications using <acronym>GPGME</acronym>
might use them to mark specific errors returned by callback handlers
if no suitable error codes (including the system errors) for
these errors exist already.
